# 🚗 EV Adoption Forecasting in Washington State

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast the future adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State using historical vehicle registration data from 2017 to 2024. It leverages machine learning regression techniques to model growth trends and support data-driven infrastructure planning for sustainable transportation.
